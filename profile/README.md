## What is PopClip?  

**PopClip** is a lightweight **productivity tool** that instantly appears when you select text, giving you quick access to actions such as copy, paste, search, translate, and run extensions. It simplifies repetitive text-based tasks, boosting efficiency for writers, developers, students, and anyone who works with text daily.  

The app seamlessly integrates with macOS, presenting a contextual pop-up menu right above selected text — similar to mobile-style actions but vastly more powerful. You can extend its functionality through **hundreds of PopClip extensions**, from simple clipboard shortcuts to automated workflows that interact with third-party apps like Evernote, ChatGPT, Notion, and Google Translate.  

**PopClip** supports custom scripting, allowing advanced users to create personalized actions that fit their workflow perfectly. Whether you need to convert case, count words, shorten URLs, or send selected text directly to another application, PopClip turns a simple selection into a command center.  

Compact yet incredibly flexible, it’s designed to stay out of the way until you need it — then instantly speeds up your everyday work across all macOS apps.
